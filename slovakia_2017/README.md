GoFish experiment with NAOs
----------------------------

This experiment is an implementation of the GoFish game using NAOs robot instead of virtual Avatars.
The files in this repository are the only one modified in order to implement the robot movements.

The code requires a CSV file called `robot.csv`. Two versions have been implemented:

1. Standard version. The robots are in autonomous mode and they are facing the participant.
2. Shared screen version. The robots share a screen with the participant and they can look both participant and screen.
