GUI 4 HRI
----------

This graphical user interface has been created for experiment in HRI.


Installation
------------

Linux:
------

1. Install qt4: `sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-designer qtcreator`
2. Inastall pyqt: `sudo apt-get install python-qt4 pyqt4-dev-tools`
3. Install choregraphe if you want to use the simulator


Windows:
--------

1. Install python 2.7 (32bit version) from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
2. Install pyQt for python 2.7 downloding the binary version from [here](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).
3. If you wanna use the simulator install choregraphe (license required) from [here](http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/software/installing.html)

Because of different problem of compatibility that i found during the porting on windows, it is better to install the 32 bit version of python and pyQt.
