This graphical user interface has been created for experiment in HRI.


Installation
------------

Linux:
------

1. Install qt4: `sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-designer qtcreator`
2. Inastall pyqt: `sudo apt-get install python-qt4 pyqt4-dev-tools`
3. Install choregraphe if you want to use the simulator


Windows:
--------

1. Install python 2.7 (32bit version) from [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
2. Install pyQt for python 2.7 downloding the binary version from [here](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download).
3. Install Python NAOqi SDK setup from the aldebaran website [here](https://community.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/resources/software)
4. If you wanna use the simulator install choregraphe (license required) from [here](http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/software/installing.html)

Because of different problem of compatibility that i found during the porting on windows, it is better to install the 32 bit version of python and pyQt. When installing pyQT it is necessary to install the version for python 2.7 which is called "PyQt4-4.11.4-gpl-Py2.7-Qt4.8.7-x32.exe".
